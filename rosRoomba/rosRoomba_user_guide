ROS bot user guide:

move with WASD  (w = forward, a = turn left, s = backward, d = turn right)
Z is a slow stop, X is stop

pan/tilt with UHJKNM (u = up, h = turn left, j = center, k = turn right, n = down, m = max down)
c also works for centering.

a single character gets you a fast, short response.
multiple characters (e.g., aaa) gets you bigger responses and, in the case of moving forward or backward, a smooth acceleration and deceleration.
The first character can be capitalized and the subsequent ones lowercase.
Otherwise, use all uppercase or all lowercase.
