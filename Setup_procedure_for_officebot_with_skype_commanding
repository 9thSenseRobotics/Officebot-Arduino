to run arduino skype stuff:

check that the arduino connects as /dev/ttyACM0

check the video devices that are connected and find out which ones they are.
Be sure that this corresponds to what is specified in the code.
Soon we will change these to parameters that are automatically set, but for now

sudo ln -s -f /dev/video1 /dev/video9'
substitute the upper camera device name for video1
and enter the sudo password when that comes up.  sudo is needed for camera device switching,
but it is just needed once per command window so it is OK

ls /dev/vid*
and make sure that /dev/video9 is there.

power up the create
start skype
check that skype video options are set to use video9 and test that there is a good video feed coming through

cd ~/cameraControl/src
gedit main.cpp

#define FIRST_VIDEO_DEVICE "/dev/video0"
#define SECOND_VIDEO_DEVICE "/dev/video1"
replace video 0 with the camera that is on top, video1 with the camera that is on the bottom
save the file and recompile with 
cd ..
make

cd ~/arduino_projects/captureSkypeChat
gedit ROS_telebot_skype_chat_cam_switching_rev1.py

go to lines 108 and 111 and 148
os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video1 /dev/video9')
os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video0 /dev/video9')
os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video0 /dev/video9')
replace video 0 with the camera that is on top, video1 with the camera that is on the bottom
save the file


roscore
rosrun captureSkypeChat ROS_telebot_skype_chat_cam_switching_rev1.py
You will have to enter the sudo password to allow it to switch cameras
rosrun cameraControl cameraControl
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
note that ttyACM0 should correspond to the arduino

should see:

look at 
rostopic list

should see:
/SkypeChat
/robot_commands
/rosout
/rosout_agg

try rostopic echo SkypeChat

connect to skype and try some commands

Skype commands:

move with WASD  (w = forward, a = turn left, s = backward, d = turn right)
Z is a slow stop, X is stop

pan/tilt with UHJKNM (u = up, h = turn left, j = center, k = turn right, n = down, m = max down)
g = center pan, b = center tilt
cam or Cam = switch cameras, both for video and pan tilt
0 = swap cameras, just for pan - tilt, not for video
1 = use first video device for pan tilt
2 = use second video device for pan tilt
3 = use symbolic video devoce for pan tilt (this is the one that should be showing video)

for WASD and UHKN:
a single character gets you a fast, short response.
multiple characters (e.g., aaa) gets you bigger responses and, in the case of moving forward or backward, a smooth acceleration and deceleration.
The first character can be capitalized and the subsequent ones lowercase.
Otherwise, use all uppercase or all lowercase.
