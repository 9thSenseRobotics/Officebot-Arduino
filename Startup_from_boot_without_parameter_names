To run the code, procedure from bootup:


check that the arduino connects as /dev/ttyACM0

check the video devices that are connected and find out which ones they are.

Be sure that this corresponds to what is specified in the code.

Soon we will change these to parameters that are automatically set, but for now



test pan/tilt with

uvcdynctrl -d /dev/video1 -s "Pan/tilt Reset" -- 3

substituting the actual device name for video1.  Do that for each camera.



sudo ln -s -f /dev/video1 /dev/video9

substitute the upper camera device name for video1

and enter the sudo password when that comes up.  sudo is needed for camera device switching,

Trying to figure  out how to make this automatic.



ls /dev/vid*

and make sure that /dev/video9 is there.



power up the create

start skype

check that skype video options are set to use video9 and test that there is a good video feed coming through


cd ~/arduino_projects/captureSkypeChat

gedit ROS_telebot_Skype_two_cams.py



go to lines 135 and 138 and 177

os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video1 /dev/video9')

os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video0 /dev/video9')

os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video0 /dev/video9')

replace video0 with the camera that is on top, video1 with the camera that is on the bottom

save the file, update git (so that this version does not get ahead of the others and cause a conflict when updating later).

roscore

rosrun captureSkypeChat ROS_telebot_skype_two_cams.py

You will have to enter the sudo password to allow it to switch cameras

roslaunch createControl createcontrol.launch

now you need to launch cameraControl, but you need to know which video feeds the cameras are using.
If they are on video0 and video1, then use:
rosrun cameraControl cameraControl_vid0_vid1
If they are on video1 and video2 then use:
rosrun cameraControl cameraControl_vid1_vid2

look at 

rostopic list

try rostopic echo SkypeChat

connect to skype with two accounts and 

enter either 

cam or Cam

and go to the terminal running

ROS_telebot_skype_two_cams.py

an enter the password.  (working on automating this)

close the extra skype account


Now you are ready to go.


Skype commands:

move with WASD  (w = forward, a = turn left, s = backward, d = turn right)

Z is a slow stop, X is stop



pan/tilt with UHJKNM (u = up, h = turn left, j = center, k = turn right, n = down, m = max down)

g = center pan, b = center tilt

cam or Cam = switch cameras, both for video and pan tilt
, this is the main way to change cameras
Sometimes it take a while to swap or fails.  If that happens, just hangup and call back and it will work fine.  Also, the small window on the bot that shows outgoing video freezes when the cameras are swapped.  Again, this is fixed if you hang up and call back.

If the video and the pan/tilt get mixed up, you can change the camera that the pan/tilt is commanding, without changing which is sending video with these commands:
0 = swap cameras, just for pan - tilt, not for video

1 = use first video device for pan tilt

2 = use second video device for pan tilt




for WASD and UHKN:

a single character gets you a fast, short response.

multiple characters (e.g., aaa) gets you bigger responses and, in the case of moving forward or backward, a smooth acceleration and deceleration.

The first character can be capitalized and the subsequent ones lowercase.

Otherwise, use all uppercase or all lowercase.
