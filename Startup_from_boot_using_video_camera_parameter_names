To run the code, procedure from bootup:

check that the arduino connects as /dev/ttyACM0

test pan/tilt with

uvcdynctrl -d /dev/pricamera -s "Pan/tilt Reset" -- 3

sudo ln -s -f /dev/pricamera  /dev/video9

and enter the sudo password when that comes up.  sudo is needed for camera device switching,

ls /dev/vid*

and make sure that /dev/video9 is there.


power up the create

start skype

check that skype video options are set to use video9 and test that there is a good video feed coming through

gedit ROS_telebot_Skype_two_cams.py

go to lines 135 and 138 and 177

os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video1 /dev/video9')

os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video0 /dev/video9')

os.system('sudo ln -s -f /dev/video0 /dev/video9')

replace video0 with the camera that is on top, video1 with the camera that is on the bottom

save the file, update git (so that this version does not get ahead of the others and cause a conflict when updating later).

roscore

rosrun captureSkypeChat ROS_telebot_skype_two_cams.py

You will have to enter the sudo password to allow it to switch cameras

roslaunch createControl createControl.launch

rosrun cameraControl cameraControl_vid1_vid2
Note that this could also be 
rosrun cameraControl cameraControl_vid1_vid2
because parameters are used, so the vid designation is overridden.

look at 

rostopic list

try rostopic echo SkypeChat


connect to skype with two accounts and 

enter either 

cam or Cam

and go to the terminal running

ROS_telebot_skype_chat_cam_switching_rev1.py

an enter the password.  (working on automating this)

close the extra skype account

Now you are ready to go.


Skype commands:

move with WASD  (w = forward, a = turn left, s = backward, d = turn right)

Z is a slow stop, X is stop

pan/tilt with UHJKNM (u = up, h = turn left, j = center, k = turn right, n = down, m = max down)

cam or Cam = switch cameras, both for video and pan tilt, this is the main way to change cameras
Sometimes it take a while to swap or fails.  If that happens, just hangup and call back and it will work fine.  Also, the small window on the bot that shows outgoing video freezes when the cameras are swapped.  Again, this is fixed if you hang up and call back.

for WASD and UHKN:

a single character gets you a fast, short response.

multiple characters (e.g., aaa) gets you bigger responses and, in the case of moving forward or backward, a smooth acceleration and deceleration.

The first character can be capitalized and the subsequent ones lowercase.

Otherwise, use all uppercase or all lowercase.
