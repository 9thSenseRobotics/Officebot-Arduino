Skype commands:

move with WASD  (w = forward, a = turn left, s = backward, d = turn right)
Z is a slow stop, X is stop

pan/tilt with UHJKNM (u = up, h = turn left, j = center, k = turn right, n = down, m = max down)
g = center pan, b = center tilt
cam or Cam = switch cameras, both for video and pan tilt
0 = swap cameras, just for pan - tilt, not for video
1 = use first video device for pan tilt
2 = use second video device for pan tilt
3 = use symbolic video devoce for pan tilt (this is the one that should be showing video)

for WASD and UHKN:
a single character gets you a fast, short response.
multiple characters (e.g., aaa) gets you bigger responses and, in the case of moving forward or backward, a smooth acceleration and deceleration.
The first character can be capitalized and the subsequent ones lowercase.
Otherwise, use all uppercase or all lowercase.
